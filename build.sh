# ── readme.txt section limits ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WordPress.org TRUNCATES an over-long readme section instead of rejecting it, so
# the plugin page silently loses content and nothing in the build complains. This
# runs after the version bump above, because that rewrites readme.txt.
#
# Two earlier hand-rolled versions of this check passed while the section was in
# fact being truncated, because they encoded the rule wrongly: the limit is counted
# in WORDS (Plugin Check's "2500 characters" message is misleading), and every
# section wordpress.org does not recognise -- "External services", "Credits" -- is
# folded into other_notes and then added onto DESCRIPTION before trimming. The
# shared script is the single source of truth; do not re-implement the rule here.
# ── The emergency brake must not make the emergency worse ────────────────────
# deploy-wordpress.sh and rollback-wordpress.sh are gitignored, so they cannot be
# fixed centrally — which is exactly why this gate is here instead. It is tracked,
# so a checkout still carrying the old scripts fails the build with the reason.
#
# All five plugins took their pre-deploy backup with
# `docker cp SRC /tmp/<plugin>-rollback 2>/dev/null || true`. docker cp copies INTO
# an existing directory, so every deploy after the first nested the real backup one
# level deeper and left the first backup ever taken at the top — the path rollback
# restores. Found 2026-08-14: the cyber-devtools Pi had 1.10.418 from 2026-08-06 at
# the top with 1.10.601 nested inside, so `bash rollback-wordpress.sh` would have
# gone back 184 patch versions and printed success, because it grepped the version
# only after restoring it.
# ── The documented artefact archive must actually be written ─────────────────
# CLAUDE.md promised a date-stamped copy of every deployed zip in archive/ and no deploy
# script wrote one, so the documented recovery path did not exist. That matters more than
# a missing convenience because build.sh rsyncs the WORKING TREE: a deploy can ship code
# that is in no commit, and on 2026-08-14 and 2026-08-17 it did. Git does not always hold
# what production runs; the archived zip does. deploy-wordpress.sh is gitignored, so this

# This used to compare CSPV_VERSION against Stable tag and nothing else, so it
# could never see the one version that matters most: the "* Version:" plugin
# header, which is what WordPress itself reads and displays. The header silently
# froze at 2.9.457 on 2026-07-25 while CSPV_VERSION and Stable tag advanced to
# 2.9.463 — six releases where WP reported a version that had not existed for
# weeks, and the check said OK every time. A gate that passes while measuring the
# wrong thing is worse than no gate, so it now asserts all three and says how
# many it compared.
